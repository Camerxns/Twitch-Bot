# Twitch-Bot
This twitch bot uses nodes package manager to run. It is a chat bot that was created for the twitch streamer Katly707, it is referred to as KatlyBot since its a bot specifically for their streams. The bot has commands such as "!hello" and "!discord" which all have their own specific responses. It also has a timer that will automatically send a message every hour linking to the streamers discord. This has been one of my most fun projects I have ever started and I am glad to say it is currently up and running on https://twitch.tv/Katly707
